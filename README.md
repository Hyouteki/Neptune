## Features
- Super lightweight.
- Quick access console in File explorer.
- Easily configure Neptune using [parameters.json](https://github.com/Hyouteki/Neptune/blob/main/parameters.json) file.
  > Later settings window would be implemeted for even more ease. 
- Everything just one click or one key-board key combination away.
  > FUNFACT: Half of this project actually written using Neptune itself; talk about turing completeness.

## Quick start

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Hyouteki/Neptune.git
  pip install imgui[full]
  ```
- Launch Neptune using `python neptune.py`.
